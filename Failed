Task #2: Identify Failed and Successful Logins

Step 1: Simulate Login Events
Successful Login:
Lock your machine (Win + L) and log in with the correct password. This will generate a successful login event (Event ID 4624). 
Failed login:
Lock your machine again and try logging in with the wrong password at least three times. This will generate failed login events (Event ID 4625).failed pic

Step 2: Detect Login Events using Windows Event Viewer
Open Event Viewer (Win + R, type eventvwr.msc, press Enter).
Click Filter Current Log and enter the following Event IDs: 4624 (4624 pic)→ Successful login, 4625 → Failed login (4625 pic)

Step 3: Retrieve Login Events using PowerShell

Check for Failed Logins
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; ID=4625} | Select-Object TimeCreated, Message | Format-Table -AutoSize (4625-2 pic)
